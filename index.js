  // The "next" (3rd) arg in the function, is the arg that tells express to

    // 1. a path to match
    // 2. a callback function that takes two args
      // 2.1. request arg is an object that contains info from the client. It is composed
      //      of an http header, and possibly a body that holds data. This represents
      //      what the client is asking of the server.
      // 2.2. response arg is an object that will hold the servers reply to the client. It will
      //      contain an http header, and possible a body that would hold data such as an HTML page.
